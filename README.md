# double-jump

There is no actual double jump. There are double worlds, tho. And they're not *quite* the same...

Fight your way to the top to confront and defeat your other-worldly doppleganger!

## Concept
The game jam brief was "Parallel Worlds". We sought to createa a Jump King like platformer that focused on interesting environment navigation and knockbacks, with a twist: you are navigating 2 worlds at once! These 2 parallel worlds are similar, but not entirely the same. Watch out for differences between the worlds that can give you the extra help you need to climb as high as you can!

There are 20 levels, in an ideal world this would be somewhere between 50 and 100, with some narrative interwoven through the level design, art, and maybe sound or interactables. Movement is fairly solid, but could be refined. Art is clearly lacking and what is there is very kit bashed, but I don't think this was too bad for a small 3 man team! Big shout out to Lawrence and Julius for their efforts!
